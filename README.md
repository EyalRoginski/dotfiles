My amazing config that everyone should use.


## System

I run Ubuntu on WSL.


## Shell

I use [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) and manage it with 
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).  The theme I use is 
[powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).


## Terminal manager

I use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) as a
plugin manager.


## Editor

I edit code (and sometimes other files) using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with 
[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as a plugin manager.
